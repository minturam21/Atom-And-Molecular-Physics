# Hydrogen Energy Levels: Bohr vs Sommerfeld Model

## About the Project
This project explores the energy levels of the hydrogen atom using Bohr and Sommerfeld models. It was developed as part of my 5th semester paper in Atomic Physics.  
        This is a small Python project where I explore the energy levels of the hydrogen atom using **Bohr’s model** and **Sommerfeld’s model**.
Bohr’s model is the classic one you learn in textbooks, while Sommerfeld adds a little relativistic correction (fine-structure stuff) to make it more accurate.
The goal is to **visualize the difference between the two models** and see how the energy levels split when you include fine structure.

## Features

* Calculate energy levels for n = 1 to 6
* Compare Bohr and Sommerfeld models in one plot
* See how relativistic correction affects energy levels
* Use simple Python libraries: **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Install required libraries if you don’t have them:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the code:

   ```bash
   python hydrogen_energy_levels.py
   ```

## What You’ll See

* A plot showing **Bohr model levels** as blue dots/line
* **Sommerfeld model levels** as red dots
* Horizontal line at 0 eV for reference
* Helps visualize energy splitting due to relativistic effects

## Tools & Libraries

* Python 3
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
